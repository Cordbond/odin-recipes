  <p></p>
  <p>
    <ol>Add the sauce to a medium saucepan and bring to a low simmer to warm through.</ol>
    <ol>While sauce simmers, heat ¼ cup vegetable oil to a cast iron skillet or heavy bottomed sauté pan over medium heat until hot, 2-3 minutes. Carefully add the chicken cutlets and pan fry on both sides until golden brown, 4-5 minutes per side, until cooked through. Cook the chicken in batches if necessary, so as not to crowd the pan. Remove to a paper-towel-lined plate.</ol>
    <ol>Place cooked chicken in a single layer in a shallow baking pan and top each chicken cutlet with a spoonful of sauce followed by an even layer of cheese. Reserve remaining sauce.</ol>
    <ol>Preheat broiler to high with rack 6 inches from heating element. Broil the chicken cutlets until cheese is golden brown and sauce begins to bubble, about 2-3 minutes. Remove from oven.</ol>
    <ol>Line a large sheet pan with aluminum foil or parchment paper and add garlic knots. Place in oven for 2-3 minutes, or until warmed through.</ol>
    <ol>To serve, place chicken on plate and pour over remaining sauce. Top with fresh basil if desired and serve alongside vegetables and bread.</ol>
